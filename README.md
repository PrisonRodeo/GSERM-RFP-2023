# GSERM: Regression for Publishing 2023

This is the Github repository for the 2023 GSERM course Regression for Publishing. The course will meet from 19-23 June 2023. This repository will eventually (soon!) contain information about the course, including the course syllabus, lecture slides, example data, example code, exercises, and examination.
